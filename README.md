# Tech-In-Tourism
The collection of the news for this research was started through the search results of Google News. Google news was chosen due to Google’s expertise in pagerank algorithm which sorts by relevance. Five keywords (“Tourism”, “Tourist”, “Hotel”, “Traveller” and “Hospitality”) were identified to represent the field of tourism for generating the search expression along with the word “Technology” using boolean operators (for eg. “Tourist AND Technology”). Hence, a total of five expressions were taken to generate queries. The news in English language and from the period 2017- 2018 was collected. In order to obtain maximum news titles, each expression was executed along with a month. 17 queries were executed per expression as the news extraction took place in June 2018. 

Using a python script, the following fields were extracted: news title, source URL, source name, date of issue and summary. Further, each source URL is visited to extract all the text for analysis. Some of the websites could not be accessed due to restrictions. Hence, all the news with less than 300 characters were discarded. 

In the end, we collected 8639 rows of valid data. Now, the text for each news was to be pre-processed before analysis. Firstly, All the extra white spaces, punctuations, stop words and numbers are removed. Then, all the characters are converted to their respective lowercase letters and the words are stemmed to down their root using Python libraries.
